# Interactive Data Grid

## Project Outline

The Interactive Data Grid project is a full-stack application that provides a dynamic and interactive data grid interface. The project consists of an Express Node.js backend with a SQLite database and a React frontend. The backend handles API requests and database interactions, while the frontend provides a user-friendly interface for interacting with the data grid.

## Architecture

The Interactive Data Grid project is designed with a modular architecture, separating the backend and frontend components to ensure scalability, maintainability, and ease of development. Below is a detailed overview of the architecture:

### Backend

The backend is built using Node.js and Express, providing a robust and scalable server-side framework. Key components of the backend include:

- **Express**: A minimal and flexible Node.js web application framework that provides a robust set of features for web and mobile applications.
- **Sequelize**: An ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) library for Node.js, used to interact with the SQLite database. Sequelize simplifies database operations by providing an abstraction layer over raw SQL queries.
- **SQLite**: A lightweight, disk-based database that doesn't require a separate server process. It is suitable for development and small-scale applications.
- **API Endpoints**: The backend exposes RESTful API endpoints for CRUD operations on the data grid. These endpoints handle requests from the frontend and interact with the database to perform the necessary operations.

### Frontend

The frontend is built using React, a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces. Key components of the frontend include:

- **React**: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces, allowing developers to create reusable UI components.
- **Material-UI**: A popular React UI framework that provides a set of pre-designed components, ensuring a consistent and visually appealing design.
- **Axios**: A promise-based HTTP client for making API requests from the frontend to the backend.
- **Data Grid**: The core component of the frontend, providing an interactive and dynamic interface for displaying and manipulating data. The data grid supports features such as pagination, sorting, filtering, and inline editing.

### Interaction Between Backend and Frontend

The backend and frontend communicate via RESTful API calls. The frontend sends HTTP requests to the backend API endpoints to fetch, update, create, or delete data. The backend processes these requests, interacts with the database using Sequelize, and returns the appropriate responses to the frontend.

### Design Patterns and Best Practices

- **Separation of Concerns**: The project follows the separation of concerns principle by dividing the application into distinct backend and frontend components. This ensures that each component can be developed, tested, and maintained independently.
- **Modular Architecture**: The use of modules and components in both the backend and frontend promotes code reusability and maintainability.
- **Error Handling**: The backend includes basic error handling mechanisms to ensure that errors are properly logged and appropriate responses are sent to the frontend.
- **Performance Optimization**: The data grid uses pagination to optimize performance for large datasets. Future improvements may include virtualization and infinite scrolling techniques.

This architecture ensures that the Interactive Data Grid project is scalable, maintainable, and easy to develop, providing a solid foundation for future enhancements and improvements.

## Assumptions Made

- **Node.js and npm**: The project assumes that Node.js and npm are installed on the development machine.
- **Operating System**: The project is developed and tested on a Windows operating system. However, it should be compatible with other operating systems such as macOS and Linux, with minor adjustments to the setup commands if necessary.
- **Modern Browser**: The frontend application is designed to run in modern web browsers such as Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, and Microsoft Edge. It is assumed that the user has access to one of these browsers for testing and usage.

## Known Limitations or Trade-offs

- The project uses SQLite as the database, which is suitable and convenient for assessments and small-scale applications but may not be ideal for production environments with high concurrency and large datasets.
- The project does not include authentication and authorization mechanisms, which may be necessary for securing the application in a production environment.
- The project uses a simple error handling mechanism and may require more robust error handling and logging for production use.

## Future Improvement Suggestions

- **Database**: Consider migrating to a more robust database system such as PostgreSQL or MySQL for production use.
- **Authentication**: Implement authentication and authorization mechanisms to secure the application.
- **Error Handling**: Enhance error handling and logging to provide better insights into application issues.
- **Testing**: Add unit tests and integration tests to ensure the reliability and stability of the application.
- **Performance**: The Data Grid uses the pagination approach for performance optimization for large datasets. Consider using the following techniques to further improve performance:
  - **Virtualization**: Implement row and column virtualization to render only the visible portion of the data grid, reducing the number of DOM elements and improving rendering performance.
  - **Infinite Scrolling**: Use infinite scrolling instead of pagination to load data incrementally as the user scrolls.
  - **Batching Updates**: Batch updates to the data grid to minimize the number of re-renders and improve performance.
  - **Efficient Data Fetching**: Optimize data fetching strategies to reduce the amount of data transferred and improve loading times.

## Installation and Setup

### 1. Install Dependencies

Navigate to the `backend` and `frontend` directories and install the necessary dependencies using npm.

```sh
# Install backend dependencies
cd backend
npm install

# Install frontend dependencies
cd ../frontend
npm install
```

### 2. Seed the Database

Seed the database by running the `seed.ts` script in the backend directory. You can use the `seed-database.bat` file in the root directory or run the script directly using the command line:

```sh
# Run the script directly using ts-node
cd backend
ts-node seed.ts
```

### 3. Start the Project

Start both the backend and frontend servers. You can use the `start-servers.bat` file or run the commands manually.

```sh

# Run the commands manually
# Start the backend server
cd backend
npm run serve

# Start the frontend server
cd ../frontend
npm run dev
```

## Running the Project

Once the servers are started, you can access the application in your web browser at [http://localhost:3030](http://localhost:3030).
